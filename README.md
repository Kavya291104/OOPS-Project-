Here's a breakdown of the code:

#include <iostream>: This line includes the iostream library, which allows the program to perform input and output operations.

using namespace std;: This line allows the program to use the standard namespace, which includes commonly used functions and classes.

int main() {...}: This is the main function where the program starts execution.

float weight, height, bmi;: These lines declare three variables of type float to store the weight, height, and BMI of the person.

cout << "Weight(kg), height(m): ";: This line displays a message prompting the user to enter their weight and height.

cin>> weight >>height;: This line reads the input values for weight and height from the user.

bmi = weight / height * height;: This line calculates the BMI of the person using the formula: weight (kg) / height (m) * height (m).
if(bmi < 18.5) cout << "Underweight"   << endl;: This line checks if the BMI is less than 18.5 and displays the message "Underweight" if true.
else if(bmi<25) cout << "Overweight" << endl;: This line checks if the BMI is less than 25 and displays the message "Overweight" if true.
else cout << "Normalweight" << endl;: This line displays the message "Normalweight" if the BMI is not less than 18.5 or 25.
cout << "your bmi is "<< bmi;:   This line displays the calculated BMI value.
system("pause>0");: This line pauses the program until the user presses a key, allowing them to see the output before the program terminates.

In summary, this program calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height and categorizes them as underweight, normal weight, or overweight based on their BMI value.
